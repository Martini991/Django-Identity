Take care of this folder that could contain private key. Be sure that this folder never is published.

Onelogin Python Toolkit expects that certs for the SP could be stored in this folder as:

 * sp.key     Private Key
 * sp.crt     Public cert
 * sp_new.crt Future Public cert


Also you can use other cert to sign the metadata of the SP using the:

 * metadata.key
 * metadata.crt

# Create your selfsigned cert as follows:
openssl req -new -x509 -days 3652 -nodes -out sp.crt -keyout sp.key

# convert pem to crt
openssl x509 -outform der -in idp.testunical.it-cert.pem -out idp.testunical.it-cert.crt
